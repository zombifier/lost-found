# LostFound

A mobile program that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The library that was used was Meteor JS, which allows us to compile the code into arduino or IOS Code!

The program is currently a work in progress, in an attempt to help WPI students find lost items

Compile it as so:

Android:
meteor run android-device --mobile-server wpilostandfound.meteor.com

IOS
meteor run ios-device --mobile-server wpilostandfound.meteor.com

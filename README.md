# WPILostFound
## About
This project was called "Not another scarf!" which was initiated at Hack@WPI by two students who both lost precious scarves at WPI. Banding together, these two young coders went out in pursuit of creating the ultimate college lost and found app!

## Underlying Technology
A mobile program that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The library that was used was Meteor JS, which allows us to compile the code into arduino or IOS Code!
